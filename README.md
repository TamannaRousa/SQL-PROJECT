# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL queries. The dataset contains information about pizza orders, including order details, order date, pizza types, quantities, and sales revenue. By querying this dataset, we can gain insights into sales trends, popular pizza choices, customer preferences, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in a SQLite database file named `pizza_sales.db`. It consists of the following tables:

- `order_details`: Contains information about order details, including order ID, pizza ID, order details ID and quantity.
- `orders`: Records details of each pizza order, such as order ID, order date and order time.
- `pizzas`: Provides information about different types of pizzas available, including pizza ID, pizza type ID, size and price.
- `pizza_types`: Represents the items (pizzas) included pizza type ID, name, ingredients and category.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Total Sales Analysis**: Calculate the total sales revenue over a specific time period.
